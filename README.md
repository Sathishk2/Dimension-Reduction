# Dimension-Reduction

Hi

Thanks for visiting my Dimension Reduction respository.

In this repository, I learn how to use Dimension Reduction to identify

1. species of flower from the iris dataset using Principal Component Analysis
2. species of flower from the iris dataset using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

This tutorial was from freecodecamp
